# Template-Compatible Layout Implementation

## Overview

This implementation converts the original HTML template layout from the `docs/web-design-agency` folder into React components for Next.js. The components follow the original structure closely while supporting:

- Dark/light theme modes
- Responsive design
- Improved accessibility
- React component best practices

## Layout Structure

The main layout structure follows the original HTML template:

1. **Topbar** - Contains social links and secondary navigation
2. **Brand & Contact** - Contains the logo and contact information
3. **Header/Navbar** - Main navigation with dropdown support
4. **Main Content** - Content area for each page
5. **Footer** - Site links, contact info, newsletter, and copyright
6. **Back to Top** - Button to scroll back to top

## Implementation Details

### CSS Strategy

We've taken a hybrid approach to styling:

1. **Template CSS** - We've created a `template.css` file that contains Bootstrap-like utility classes similar to the original template
2. **Tailwind CSS** - We've kept Tailwind for component-specific styling
3. **CSS Modules** - Used for component-specific styles where needed

### Component Architecture

Each layout section is implemented as two components:

1. A client component (e.g., `TemplateTopbar.tsx`) - Contains all client-side logic and interactivity
2. A server component wrapper - For improved HMR performance

### Theme Support

Dark mode support is implemented through:
- CSS variables for colors in `template.css`
- Theme-specific classes with the `dark:` prefix
- The `next-themes` library for managing theme state

## Testing

You can test the layout by visiting the `/layout-test` route which displays a test page using the template-compatible layout.

## Future Improvements

- Implement dropdown menu functionality for mobile navigation
- Further optimize images and CSS for better performance
- Improve component reusability and composition
- Add animations and transitions per the original template
